# About me

## Work

I have worked in digital for ten years now and specialise in building beautiful, organised, accessible interfaces.

I like to work on a range of ventures, from smaller, visually creative storytelling projects to large, thoughtful, design systems.

Please contact me [here](/contact) for the quickest response, or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sally-northmore-5568489/).

## Life

In my free time, I focus on the things I love most: gardening, environmentalism, running, piano, and most things live-performed.

Currently I run a project called [The Switch](https://www.instagram.com/theswitchorg/), where I document our householdâ€™s transition away from its dependence on plastic, towards a less throwaway life. Itâ€™s a particular goal of mine, and 2019 is my first real go of it ðŸ¤ž.
